Note: This mod works on Linux and Mac out of the box.
To run this mod on Windows you need the WIDCOMM bluetooth stack, which comes with many bluetooth-devices (All by broadcom and also some noname). If your device isn't supported by the WIDCOMM bluetooth stack you can try [url=https://xii9190.wordpress.com/2008/05/15/bluetooth-still-not-working-with-wii/|_blank]this hack[/url] (requires a WIDCOMM bluetooth dongle during installation but not later on) or [url=http://forum.gsmhosting.com/vbb/f237/how-install-widcomm-drivers-342643/|_blank]this hack[/url] (requires no WIDCOMM bluetooth dongle).
I'm not responsible for any damage to your computer when using those hacks!!!

[spoiler]I'll record a showcase video soon, but for now: Here is a small demo video I made during development:

[left][size=18px]Installation:[/size][/left]
[spoiler][numlist]
[*]Get the latest version of forge for 1.8 (Installer) from [url=http://files.minecraftforge.net/|_blank]here[/url].
I tested it with 11.14.0.1296 but other versions should also work.
Install it, start your Minecraft and close it again.
[*]Download MoteCraft from [url=http://freundtech.bplaced.net/files/motecraft/motecraft-0.4.jar|_blank]here[/url] and put it in the mods folder in your .minecraft folder.
[*]Download my custom modified versions of motej-library and motej-extras (licensed under [url=http://motej.sourceforge.net/license.html|_blank]Apache License Version 2.0[/url]) from [url=http://freundtech.bplaced.net/files/motecraft/motej-library-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar|_blank]here[/url] and [url=http://freundtech.bplaced.net/files/motecraft/motej-extras-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar|_blank]here[/url].
Also put them in your mods folder.
[*]Download Bluecove-2.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar from [url=http://snapshot.bluecove.org/distribution/download/2.1.1-SNAPSHOT/2.1.1-SNAPSHOT.63/|_blank]here[/url] and also put it in your mods folder. If you are running Linux also download Bluecove-gpl-2.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar from the same link.
[*]Turn Bluetooth on your PC on and start Minecraft. As soon as the mojang logo appears press 1 & 2 on your wii remote. Wait until Minecraft found your remote, plug in your nunchuck and you should be ready to play. (If Minecraft doesn't find your remote try restarting it.)
[/numlist][/spoiler]

[left][size=18px]Controls[/size][/left]
[spoiler][size=16px]Walking[/size]
Use the analog stick on the nunchuck to walk around.
Move it forward to sneak/walk/run forwards (depending on how far you move it forward).
Move it to the sides to look left and right. The further you move it the faster you turn.
Press Z to lock your view. Instead of rotating you will now walk sideways when moving the analog stick to the sides.
Press C to jump.
Tilt your nunchuck to look up/down/left/right. Because the accelerometer is very inaccurate I had to apply some smoothing.

[size=16px]Interaction[/size]
Press A on your Remote and shake the Remote to break Blocks and hit Mobs/Players.
Press B on your Remote to use Items. Bows and Swords are used by just pressing B. Other Items require pressing B and shaking the Remote.
Press Home on your Remote to open/close your Inventory.
Press +/- on your Remote to switch through your Hotbar-slots.

[size=16px]Inventory[/size]
When inside an Inventory move your remote around to change the cursor location.
Press A to click and B to rightclick.
NOTE: You need to have an Infrared Emitter for the remote as reference Point for this to work.
I suggest putting the Wii Sensorbar in front of your monitor and just turning your Wii on.
Other things might also work (I've heard you can use candles, but haven't tested it.)

May try taking some damage? ;)[/spoiler]
